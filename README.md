GetVideoThumbs
==============

Processwire module for automatically populates an images field with thumbnails (poster imagses) from YouTube and Vimeo

It allows you to enter URLs to YouTube and Vimeo videos in specified fields, and when you save the page it will grab thumbnails for the video and add them to a specified images field.

Check the module configuration options for:
* the field(s) to search for videos
* name of the video images field
* which thumbnail(s) you want grabbed
* whether to grab the first available or all available thumbnails based on those that you list
* whether or not you want automatic renaming of the images to a standardized format for easier inclusion in templates via API calls
